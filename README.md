# Statistics and Data Science Portfolio by Charles Dunn

This portfolio is a compilation of Jupyter Notebooks intended to showcase my ongoing research into statistics and data visualization.


## Regression

### House Prices: Advanced Linear Regression with NLME in R

 This is my own analysis of a dataset aimed at predict house prices using linear mixed effects models. In this project I utilize and explore many of the opportunities presented with general linear modeling including heteroscedasticity, spatial correlation, and random effects.

### Analysis of Web Bounce Times: When _Not_ to use Mixed Models

This is my own analysis of a dataset aimed at predicting web bounce times for cooking websites based on age across eigth different UK counties. I came across the dataset after seeing someone (somewhat naiively) analyzing it via a linear mixed effect model. However, rather than being another example of the power of these models, it turned out to be a great example of how easily they can be misused, and misinterpreted.
